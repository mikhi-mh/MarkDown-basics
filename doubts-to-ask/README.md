# mark-down-docs

just learned a new thing
If you want to make any word both bold and italic

This is ***WORD*** is both.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well documented.
I have a doubt

1) This is **Bold** or __Bold__
2) This is *Italic or _italic_
3) This is ~~StrikeThrough~~ or ~STrikeThrough~



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Talking about CheckLists
there should be a gap or one space (for unchecked)
1) hyphen(-) and [
2) [ and ,the ]
3) ] and text

My Key-TakeAways
Correct way for UnChecked :
- [ ] item 1

It should be read as

-OneSpace [OneSpace ]OneSpace iten 1

I have tried but two or more spaces are not working

And for checked
- [x] item 2
- [X] item 3

for checked list , lowercase(x) to uppercase(X) would be fine for X

Also, we can nest the check-list
checked nested list
- [ ] item 1
    - [ ] item 1.0
    - [ ] item 1.1
    - [x] item 1.2
    - [X] item 1.3
- [ ] item 2
- [ ] item 3

----------------------------------------------------


this is page portion

---
minimum three consecutive dashes or hyphen (---) are required
___
or you can use three consecutive under_scores (___)
***
or you can use three consecutive as-terisk (***)
this is another page portion   


# Tables   
Thanks for sharing :
My learnings 
Problem --- List inside the table in MarkDown is not valid
Solution --- You must go with HTML for this   

#  

---

also you can use hr tag

<hr>

this is before hr tag <hr> this is after hr tag
---

this is line1.
this is line2.
this is line3.  
see not working


this is line1  
this is line2  
(this is line1 --- 2 spaces -- next line this is line2)

- [X] item 1.3
- [ ] item 2

# Code   
Earlier, I knew only inline code.
Glad to know about the code block.

Also, it was good to learn about diff, +, and - .
Surely, it will be more useful.

Thank you very much !    
   
   
# Comments    

One more thing I just learned.
Since I knew HTML tags...
You can select continuous lines and
press "Ctrl + /" (i.e. Control and Forward Slash)
or press "Command + / " (i.e., Command and Forward Slash)
to comment on that area/ lines.
It will automatically add a comment tag.   



# Collapse   
### Doubt 1   
I have doubt
Q: There should be a line break inside summary sections, is it?
Like is it necessary?   

### Dount 2    

I find this a little bit harder.

What I got, I will summarize here:
1) Inside tag, on to the new line, there should be a space first (only one space), and then the actual tag.
2) There should be a blank line (or maybe a line break) inside the summary tag.
And then a single (and only one) space, and then an actual description.

Please correct me if I am wrong or give me a suggestion.
I have spent more time as compared to other topics in MarkDown.   

# Not so last page   

Thank You very much Eddie.
I have learned too much about mark-down today.
As I completed the first session, I had not stopped. It was so fun learning and playing around with it. I completed it.

Eddie Jaoude, just gave the to-the-point explanationüî•.
I just loved üíó the way of explanation.

Can't wait to apply while contributing...
I am also excited about applying this to my customized GitHub profile.
Not only that but also now I can write README better or document better.

Thanksüôèüèª to the EddieHub, for the better GitHub üòÑ

I will also make a custom landing page and will share.
